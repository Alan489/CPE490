//NetworkInterface.Java


//Creates a way of communicating back and forth between client and server.
//When this Interface is configured with a NULL for its IP, the interface will instatiate as a server.
//All communications are very basic. Server will take in requests from clients and then pass it on immediately to all
//Connected Clients.
